# eDIN+ Component (Platform) for Home Assistant

Tested on HA 2022.11.3 and eDIN+ firmware SW00120.2.4.1.44

Currently there is only support for brightness control using the 8Ch Dimmer.

Lighting channels must be assigned to a scene in order to be discovered.

The state of this component is: Local Polling

## Installation
### Adding the eDIN+ Component to Home Assistant
The **edinplus.py** files need to be placed in the installation directory of Home Assistant. For me this is
```
<config_dir>/custom_components/edinplus/__init__.py
<config_dir>/custom_components/edinplus/conifg_flow.py
<config_dir>/custom_components/edinplus/edinplus.py
<config_dir>/custom_components/edinplus/light.py
<config_dir>/custom_components/edinplus/manifest.json
``` 
There are instructions to follow on the instructions on the home-assistant website. If you need help, let me know.

### Configuring the eDIN+ component

To setup the eDIN+ component, first ensure homeassistant has been rebooted. Then add the integration through the integrations page https://{ip}:8123/config/integrations as you normally would. 

Currently it will prompt for data input without any explaining text - this is the hostname or IP address of the eDIN+ NPU (network processing unit). 

Please ensure it is in the format: "192.168.1.100" (excluding quotes). 

From there, it should autodiscover all channels that are assigned to scenes.
